# FlexomUnofficialApi

Unofficial Flexom 2.0 API because I want to automate things flexom's app doesnt allow me to.

## Installation
Install dependencies using pip
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
WIP

## Notes
WIP

## Licensing
I don't give specific licensing for the specific reason that I don't really
know what I want to use. As for the time being, personal usage is allowed and
entreprise and commercial usage isn't.
